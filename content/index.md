Hello and thanks for stopping by.

I'm currently working as Software Engineer at one of the largest banks in the US.
My primary focus area is Mainframe and associated technologies.

I started taking notes during one of the major shifts in technology when I started working outside the mainframe world. This site just makes them available to public. They may not be complete. I keep updating them as I learn further.
